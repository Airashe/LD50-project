    - data: 'On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
        men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
        moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble
        that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
        duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking
        from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
        In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing
        prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
        welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to
        the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur
        that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man
        therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he
        rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains
        to avoid worse pains.'
